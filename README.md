**VayuLekha - A Fun Pad!**

VayuLekha is a simple, fun, and accessible digital drawing (paint-style) web app designed especially for children with disabilities.
It helps children enjoy writing and drawing in a pressure-free, book-free way using gestures, colors, and interaction.


**Why VayuLekha ?**
⇓
Some children are not always comfortable or interested in writing on books.
VayuLekha turns practice into play, making learning feel exciting rather than forced.


**Why I Built VayuLekha**

Many projects are built around abstract problem statements that are not always connected to real life.
I chose VayuLekha for one simple and personal reason - real experience.

I have a brother who is a person with intellectual and physical disabilities.
He can write, but writing in books has never felt engaging, fun, or motivating for him. It often feels like a task, not an experience. There is learning, but very little joy in it.

So I built VayuLekha especially for him.

This app gives him a fun and pressure-free space to draw, write, and explore using technology.
After homework and daily routines, VayuLekha becomes a way for him to relax, enjoy, and still learn something new - without feeling forced.

This project is dedicated to him, and to every child who deserves learning experiences that feel joyful, inclusive, and meaningful.


**Thoughtful Features**

**1. Simple Login**
         Children type their name to practice keyboard usage and memory.
         A family mobile number is included to help them remember and safely recall it when needed.

**2. Short Tutorial (8 seconds)**
         A quick, engaging video explains one simple rule:
         Pinch thumb + index finger to draw or erase, release to stop.

**3. Fun Drawing Canvas**
         Multiple bright color palettes.
         Clear (fix mistakes) and Delete (reset canvas) options.
         Real-time indicator for Draw / Erase mode.

**4. Light & Dark Canvas**
         Children can switch between light (sun) and dark (moon) backgrounds.

**5. Download Drawing**
